## Stock Market Basics

### Purpose and Functioning of Stock Markets

The stock market is a platform where individuals and institutions can buy and sell securities, primarily stocks, which represent ownership in publicly traded companies. Its main purpose is to facilitate the transfer of capital between investors and companies, allowing companies to raise funds for growth and investors to potentially earn returns on their investments.

Stock markets provide a centralized marketplace where buyers and sellers can interact. The fundamental principle behind stock market functioning is the concept of supply and demand. When there is high demand for a particular stock, its price tends to rise, and when there is low demand, the price may decline.

### Key Stock Market Terms

To navigate the stock market, it's crucial to understand some key terms:

- Stocks: Also known as shares or equities, stocks represent ownership in a company. When you purchase stocks, you become a shareholder, entitled to a portion of the company's profits and voting rights.

- Indices: Stock market indices are statistical measures used to track the performance of a group of stocks representing a specific market or sector. Examples include the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), and NASDAQ Composite.

- Exchanges: Stock exchanges are platforms where securities are traded. Notable exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NASDAQ, London Stock Exchange (LSE), and Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). Each exchange has its own listing requirements and trading rules.

- Ticker Symbols: Ticker symbols are unique alphabetic codes assigned to each publicly traded company. They are used to identify specific stocks during trading. For instance, Apple Inc. uses the ticker symbol AAPL.

### Primary Stock Exchanges

The primary stock exchanges play a crucial role in global financial markets. Let's look at two prominent exchanges:

- New York Stock Exchange (NYSE): Established in 1792, the NYSE is the largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization. It has strict listing requirements, making it home to many well-established companies.

- NASDAQ: Founded in 1971, NASDAQ is an electronic marketplace known for listing technology and growth-oriented companies. Unlike the NYSE, which relies on a physical trading floor, NASDAQ operates through a computerized system.

These exchanges provide a platform for investors to buy and sell stocks, ensuring transparency, liquidity, and fair trading practices. Understanding the primary stock exchanges helps you track and analyze the performance of specific stocks and make informed investment decisions.

## Types of Stocks

In this section, we will delve into the different types of stocks that you may encounter while trading. Understanding these types of stocks will help you make informed investment decisions and tailor your portfolio to your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### Common Stocks and Preferred Stocks

Common Stocks: Common stocks are the most prevalent type of stock that investors trade. When you own common stocks, you possess ownership rights in the company, giving you a stake in its profits and assets. Common stockholders typically have voting rights in corporate matters, such as electing board members and approving major decisions. However, common stockholders are generally last in line to receive assets if a company goes bankrupt.

Preferred Stocks: Preferred stocks, on the other hand, offer certain advantages over common stocks. Preferred stockholders have a higher claim on a company's assets and earnings compared to common stockholders. They have a fixed dividend rate that must be paid before dividends can be distributed to common stockholders. Preferred stockholders usually do not have voting rights or have limited voting rights in corporate matters. Preferred stocks are often considered a hybrid security, combining characteristics of both stocks and bonds.

### Classification of Stocks

Growth Stocks: Growth stocks belong to companies that are expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to other companies in the market. These companies reinvest their earnings into expanding their business operations, rather than paying out dividends. Investors are attracted to growth stocks because of their potential for capital appreciation. However, they are generally considered more volatile and may be subject to higher risks.

Value Stocks: Value stocks are stocks of companies that are believed to be undervalued or trading below their intrinsic value. Investors seek value stocks based on the belief that the market has overlooked or underestimated the company's true worth. Value stocks often pay dividends and are considered more stable compared to growth stocks. They may offer steady income potential and potentially lower volatility.

Dividend Stocks: Dividend stocks are stocks that regularly distribute a portion of their earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends. Dividend stocks are favored by investors seeking a steady income stream. Dividend payments can provide a cushion against market downturns and contribute to overall portfolio returns. Dividend stocks can be found in various sectors and industries.

### Market Capitalisation

Market capitalisation (market cap) refers to the total value of a company's outstanding shares of stock in the market. Market cap is calculated by multiplying the current stock price by the number of shares outstanding. It is used to categorize companies into different size segments. The three primary categories of market capitalization are:

- Large-Cap: Large-cap stocks belong to companies with a market capitalization typically exceeding billions of dollars. These companies are often well-established and have a long track record of stability. Large-cap stocks are considered more stable and less volatile compared to mid-cap and small-cap stocks.

- Mid-Cap: Mid-cap stocks belong to companies with a market capitalization between large-cap and small-cap stocks. These companies are generally in a phase of growth and expansion, offering a potential balance of growth and stability.

- Small-Cap: Small-cap stocks belong to companies with a market capitalization on the lower end of the spectrum. These companies are often newer or in their early stages of growth. Small-cap stocks tend to be more volatile, with the potential for higher returns but also increased risk.

Understanding the different types of stocks, their classifications, and market capitalization will help you identify investment opportunities that align with your investment objectives and risk tolerance. It is essential to consider these factors when constructing a diversified portfolio that suits your financial goals.

## Technical Analysis

Technical analysis is a method of evaluating and predicting the future price movements of stocks based on historical market data, primarily focusing on price and volume patterns. It involves studying charts, patterns, and various technical indicators to identify potential trends and make informed trading decisions. This section will introduce you to the key concepts and tools used in technical analysis.

### Chart Patterns

Chart patterns are graphical representations of historical price movements that can provide valuable insights into the behavior of stocks. By recognizing recurring patterns, traders attempt to predict future price movements. Here are some commonly observed chart patterns:

- Support and Resistance Levels: Support refers to a price level where buying pressure typically exceeds selling pressure, causing the stock price to bounce back. Resistance, on the other hand, is a price level where selling pressure tends to exceed buying pressure, leading to a potential price decrease. Identifying these levels can help determine potential entry and exit points for trades.

- Trendlines: Trendlines are lines drawn on a price chart to connect a series of higher lows (uptrend) or lower highs (downtrend). They provide a visual representation of the stock's overall price direction and can assist in identifying potential trend reversals.

- Moving Averages: Moving averages are calculated by averaging a stock's price over a specific period of time. They smooth out price fluctuations, making it easier to identify trends. Commonly used moving averages include the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average.

### Popular Technical Indicators

Technical indicators are mathematical calculations applied to historical price and volume data. They help traders analyze stock trends, volatility, momentum, and other factors influencing price movements. Here are some widely used technical indicators:

- Relative Strength Index (RSI): RSI measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100, with readings above 70 indicating overbought conditions and readings below 30 suggesting oversold conditions.

- Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): MACD combines two moving averages to identify potential buy and sell signals. It consists of a MACD line, a signal line, and a histogram. When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it may indicate a bullish signal, while a crossover below the signal line may suggest a bearish signal.

- Bollinger Bands: Bollinger Bands consist of three lines plotted on a price chart: a middle band (usually a 20-day moving average) and an upper and lower band that represent standard deviations from the middle band. Bollinger Bands help identify periods of high or low volatility, and when the price touches the bands, it can indicate potential trend reversals.

### Using Technical Analysis for Trade Decisions

Technical analysis can be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis or as a standalone approach. It helps traders identify potential entry and exit points for trades and assess the probability of price movements based on historical patterns and indicators. However, it's important to note that technical analysis is not foolproof and should be used alongside risk management strategies.

By analyzing chart patterns, technical indicators, and trends, traders can gain insights into the stock's potential future price movements. It is essential to consider other factors such as market conditions, news, and fundamental analysis to make well-informed trading decisions. Regularly monitoring and updating your technical analysis tools can help refine your trading strategies over time.

## Risk Management

Risk management is a crucial aspect of trading stocks that aims to minimize potential losses and protect your investment capital. By implementing effective risk management strategies, you can maintain a disciplined approach to trading and increase your chances of long-term success. This section will explore various concepts and techniques related to risk management.

### Developing a Risk Management Strategy

Before entering the stock market, it is essential to establish a well-defined risk management strategy. This strategy outlines how you will manage your trades, allocate capital, and control potential risks. Consider the following elements when developing your risk management strategy:

a) Risk Tolerance: Assess your personal risk tolerance level, which reflects the amount of risk you are comfortable taking. It is crucial to align your risk tolerance with your investment objectives and financial situation.

b) Risk-reward Ratio: Determine an acceptable risk-reward ratio for each trade. This ratio represents the potential gain you expect relative to the potential loss. A favorable risk-reward ratio helps ensure that potential profits outweigh potential losses.

c) Maximum Loss Limits: Set predefined maximum loss limits for individual trades and overall portfolio. These limits act as safeguards and prevent excessive losses from adversely impacting your trading capital.

d) Trade Position Sizing: Determine the appropriate position size for each trade based on your risk tolerance and the trade's potential risk. Position sizing ensures that you allocate an appropriate percentage of your trading capital to each trade, reducing the impact of any single trade on your portfolio.

### Setting Stop-Loss Orders

A stop-loss order is a risk management tool that automatically triggers a sell order when a stock reaches a specific price level. It helps limit potential losses by allowing you to exit a trade if the market moves against you. Here are key points to consider when setting stop-loss orders:

a) Stop-Loss Level: Determine the price level at which you are willing to exit the trade. This level should be based on technical analysis, support levels, or other relevant factors.

b) Trailing Stop-Loss: Consider using a trailing stop-loss order, which adjusts the stop-loss level as the stock price moves in your favor. This allows you to lock in profits while still protecting against potential reversals.

c) Stop-Loss Placement: Place your stop-loss order at a level that minimizes the chances of being triggered by short-term price fluctuations while still providing adequate protection against significant losses.

### Diversifying Your Portfolio

Diversification is a risk management technique that involves spreading your investments across different stocks, sectors, and asset classes. By diversifying your portfolio, you reduce the impact of any single stock or sector on your overall investment performance. Consider the following points when diversifying your portfolio:

a) Stock Selection: Invest in stocks from various industries or sectors. This ensures that your portfolio is not overly reliant on the performance of a single sector or company.

b) Asset Allocation: Allocate your capital across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, or real estate. Diversifying your investments beyond stocks helps mitigate risks associated with specific market conditions or economic factors.

c) Risk Correlation: Consider the correlation between different stocks or asset classes. Ideally, choose investments that have low or negative correlations, as this can provide additional diversification benefits.

### Position Sizing Techniques

Position sizing involves determining the appropriate amount of capital to allocate to each trade based on your risk tolerance and the trade's potential risk. Proper position sizing helps control the overall risk exposure of your portfolio. Here are a few common position sizing techniques:

a) Fixed Dollar Amount: Allocate a fixed dollar amount or percentage of your trading capital to each trade. This technique ensures consistent risk exposure regardless of the stock's price or volatility.

b) Fixed Percentage of Capital: Allocate a fixed percentage of your total trading capital to each trade. This approach adjusts position sizes based on changes in your portfolio's value, allowing for more flexibility.

c) Volatility-based Position Sizing: Consider position sizes based on the volatility of the stock or market. For example, you may allocate more capital to less volatile stocks and less capital to highly volatile stocks.

Remember, position sizing techniques should align with your risk management strategy and risk tolerance. Regularly review and adjust your position sizes as market conditions and your portfolio evolve.

By implementing effective risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders, diversifying your portfolio, and employing appropriate position sizing techniques, you can protect your capital and increase your chances of achieving long-term success in stock trading.

## Types of Orders

When trading stocks, it is essential to understand the different types of orders you can place to execute your trades effectively. Each type of order serves a specific purpose and can impact the price at which your trade is executed. Let's explore the three primary types of stock orders: market orders, limit orders, and stop orders.

### Market Orders

A market order is the most basic and straightforward type of order. When you place a market order, you are instructing your broker to buy or sell a stock at the current market price. The trade is executed immediately, ensuring a swift transaction. Market orders prioritise speed over price, meaning the execution price may differ slightly from the current quoted price due to market fluctuations.

Market orders are suitable when you want to enter or exit a position quickly and are less concerned about the exact price of execution. However, it's important to note that during periods of high volatility, the price at which a market order is executed can deviate significantly from the expected price.

### Limit Orders

A limit order allows you to set a specific price at which you are willing to buy or sell a stock. Unlike market orders, limit orders provide control over the execution price. When placing a buy limit order, you specify the maximum price you are willing to pay, while a sell limit order indicates the minimum price at which you are willing to sell.

Once you've entered a limit order, it remains in effect until it is either executed or canceled. If the stock's market price reaches your specified limit price, the trade will be executed. However, if the price does not reach your limit, the trade will not be filled.

Limit orders are particularly useful for investors who want to buy or sell at a specific price level. They provide more control over the execution price but may take longer to be filled, especially if the market does not reach your specified limit.

### Stop Orders

Stop orders, also known as stop-loss orders or stop-buy orders, are designed to limit potential losses or initiate a trade when a specific price level is reached. These orders are conditional and are only triggered when the stock's price reaches or surpasses a specified stop price.

A sell stop order is placed below the current market price and is triggered if the stock's price drops to or below the specified stop price. It is commonly used as a risk management tool to automatically sell a stock and limit potential losses if the price falls below a predetermined threshold.

Conversely, a buy stop order is placed above the current market price and is triggered if the stock's price rises to or exceeds the specified stop price. This order type is often utilized by traders who want to enter a position once the stock surpasses a certain resistance level, ensuring they don't miss out on potential price gains.

Stop orders are powerful tools for automating trade execution based on predefined price levels. They can be particularly valuable when you are unable to actively monitor the market at all times.

Understanding these different types of orders will help you navigate the stock market more effectively. By selecting the appropriate order type based on your trading goals and risk tolerance, you can optimise your trade executions and manage your portfolio more efficiently.
