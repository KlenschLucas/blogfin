4. **Decentralized Applications (DApps)**: DApps are applications built on blockchain networks, offering various financial services without intermediaries. These applications leverage smart contracts to enable functionalities such as lending, borrowing, decentralized exchanges, and yield farming.

To better understand how DeFi works in practice, consider the example of a decentralized lending platform. Users can lend their digital assets to the platform, and smart contracts automatically match lenders with borrowers, ensuring the terms of the loan are transparent and enforced. Once the loan period expires, the borrower repays the loan along with any agreed-upon interest, and the lender receives their funds plus interest. All these processes occur automatically and transparently on the blockchain, without the involvement of traditional financial intermediaries.

DeFi applications and protocols continue to evolve, offering an extensive range of financial services to users. It is important to note that while DeFi presents exciting opportunities, it also comes with its own set of risks and challenges, which will be discussed in a later section.
