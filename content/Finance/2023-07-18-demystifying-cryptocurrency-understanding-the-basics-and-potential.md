Instead, it relies on a network of participants called miners to validate transactions and maintain the integrity of the system.

## 4.2 How Bitcoin Works: Mining, Transactions, and Wallets

### Mining

Bitcoin operates on a technology called blockchain, which is a distributed ledger that records all transactions in a transparent and immutable manner. Miners play a crucial role in the Bitcoin network by verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain.

Mining involves solving complex mathematical puzzles to validate and bundle transactions into blocks. Miners compete to solve these puzzles through computational power, and the first miner to find a solution is rewarded with newly minted bitcoins. This process not only secures the network but also regulates the creation of new bitcoins, ensuring a limited and predictable supply.

### Transactions

Bitcoin transactions are conducted through cryptographic keys. Each user has a pair of keys: a public key, which serves as their wallet address and can be shared with others, and a private key, which should be kept confidential as it grants access to the funds. When a user initiates a transaction, they sign it with their private key to provide proof of ownership and prevent unauthorized access.

Transactions are broadcasted to the Bitcoin network, where miners validate and include them in blocks. Once a transaction is confirmed by multiple blocks, it becomes more secure and irreversible. The decentralized nature of the blockchain ensures transparency, as anyone can view and verify transactions on the public ledger.

### Wallets

Bitcoin wallets are software applications that allow users to store, send, and receive bitcoins. Wallets manage the user's private keys and interact with the blockchain to track balances and create transactions. There are various types of wallets, including desktop wallets, mobile wallets, web wallets, and hardware wallets.

Desktop wallets are installed on a user's computer, providing full control over the private keys. Mobile wallets offer similar functionality but are designed for use on smartphones. Web wallets are accessible through web browsers, offering convenience but with increased security risks. Hardware wallets store private keys offline on a secure device, providing the highest level of security.
